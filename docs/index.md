# Feather

Feather is a light-weight protocol for sandboxed code execution on the web.

It is created to make it easier to create tutorials and documentation with live examples.

## Goals

* Simple - easy to use interface
* Light-weight - easy to get it up and running
* Extensible - easy to build custom runtimes for different languages and environments
* Pluggable - easily pluggable into existing documentation generators and content management systems

## Protocol

See [The Feather Protocol](protocol.md) page.

## Implementations

The [Feather python runtime][feather-python] is a work-in-progress reference implementation of the Feather protocol.
